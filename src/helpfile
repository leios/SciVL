This is a Scientific Visualization Library specifically for simulations on the
LeiosOS youtube channel and simuleios Twitch stream, please note that it is a 
work in progress and will be consistently developed in the future

Here are the commandline options:
-h                  Print helpfile
-r 1000x1000        Set resolution
-s test             Set simulation type
-f                  Set fullscreen mode (if available)
-p                  Set print mode (black, white, grey)

More arguments to come!
